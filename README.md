## Inspiration

We all love the CoolMathGames game Papa’s Freezeria, so we decided to create our own version of it!

## The Team
- Aparna Roy
- John Fulkerson
- Emilie Barniak
- Sneha Nangelimalil
- Zonglin Wu

## How It Works

In this game, you'll receive orders in the form of tickets, and your goal is to create the requested milkshakes by dragging and dropping ingredients into the cups. Each successful milkshake earns you points, and as you progress, the difficulty ramps up. With each order comes a time limit, and if you miss 3 orders, it's game over. 

How many orders can you complete before time runs out? Play today to test your milkshake-making skills!

## How We Built It

We stuck to the basics to create this game:

- JavaScript
- CSS and jQuery (to animate the game)
- HTML
